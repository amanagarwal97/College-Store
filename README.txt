Explanation : When a user requests a page say index.php the requests goes to public/index.php from there it is transferred to the corresponding controller say store.php . 
              The controller then works on the request by interacting with the appropriate model and then rendering the appropriate view. In this way MVC is implemented 
              and user has only access to the public folder.
